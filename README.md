Advent of Code 2015

My JavaScript solutions to http://adventofcode.com/

You should try Advent of Code yourself before reading further! This repo contains spoilers, including the hidden Part 2 problems.

This is sporadically written in ES6. It should run on Node 4.x

To get started:

- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm test` (or `npm test 1` for a specific day)

You should see passing tests for all days. Bugs, suggestions, and questions welcome.

PRs are also welcome, but please note:

- The goal of this code is not brevity. PRs should improve the _approach_ to a problem.
- Be sure to run `npm test` before submitting PRs :)
